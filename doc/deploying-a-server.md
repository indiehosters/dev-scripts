# Deploying a server

* Get a CoreOS server, for instance from [RackSpace](rackspace.com) or [Vultr](vultr.com).
* Copy your laptop's public ssh key (probably in `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`) to `indiehosters/hoster-data/orchestration/id_rsa.pub`
* Wait for someone to write the next step, to continue from here! :)
